# Countdown Timer Website

## Introduction

Hello, fellow developers! Today, I'm excited to share a project I recently completed: a **Countdown Timer**. This project is a great way to learn and practice JavaScript, particularly in the areas of time manipulation and DOM updates. Whether you're looking to build a countdown for an event, a product launch, or just a fun timer, this project is a perfect start.

## Project Overview

The **Countdown Timer** allows users to set a target date and time, and it will continuously count down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until that moment arrives. The timer updates in real-time, offering a visually appealing and responsive design. This project is ideal for developers who want to enhance their skills in creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

## Features

- **Real-Time Countdown**: The timer updates every second, showing the remaining time until the specified date.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Customizable End Date**: The target date and time can be easily modified, making the timer versatile for various events.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content on the webpage.
- **CSS**: Applied for styling the webpage and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented for calculating the time remaining and updating the DOM in real-time.


## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
